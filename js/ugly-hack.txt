This felt like an ugly hack that I felt I needed to document it:

I modified the script owl.carousel.min.js (which is some existing js
library in minimal version, for the sliders in the website).
The original text had:
navClass:["owl-prev","owl-next"]
somewhere, but I changed the order to
navClass:["owl-next","owl-prev"]
in order to fix the behaviour of the arrows (so that the right arrow
will move the slider to the right, and the left arrow will move the
slider to the left).
Then the right arrow and left arrow were switched, which was good, but
I had to switch their images back.  So in main.js, I modified:
navText: [
  "<i class='ti-arrow-left owl-direction'></i>",
  "<i class='ti-arrow-right owl-direction'></i>"
]
to:
navText: [
  "<i class='ti-arrow-right owl-direction'></i>",
  "<i class='ti-arrow-left owl-direction'></i>"
]

TLDR: modified js/owl.caroussel.min.js and js/main.js in order to fix
the behaviour of the arrow buttons in the sliders.
